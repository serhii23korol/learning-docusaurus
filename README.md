# Learning Docusaurus

A Docusaurus documentation site built with TypeScript.

🌐 **Live site:** https://serhii23korol.github.io/learning-docusaurus/

## Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 20 (see `engines.node` in `my-website/package.json`).
- npm or yarn installed.

## Quick start (development)

### macOS / Linux

```bash
cd my-website
npx docusaurus start
```

The site will be available at http://localhost:3000 by default.

## Deployment

This site is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions on every push to `main`.

The workflow builds the Docusaurus project inside the `my-website/` folder and publishes the output to the `gh-pages` branch.

For full details on the deployment setup, configuration, and troubleshooting, see the [Deployment Guide](https://serhii23korol.github.io/learning-docusaurus/docs/deployment) on the live site.
